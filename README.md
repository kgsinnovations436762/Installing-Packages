# Installing-Packages

 **Package Installation**

During the development of the sAfe steP project, we faced several challenges while setting up the Raspberry Pi environment. Installing the required packages and libraries was not always straightforward â€” some dependencies conflicted, a few packages took extra time to configure, and we had to try multiple solutions before everything worked properly.

After a lot of effort and troubleshooting, we successfully completed the installation process. All the necessary Raspberry Pi packages and libraries are now properly set up, ensuring that the system runs smoothly and supports the functionality of the project.

This repository includes the installation details so that anyone who wants to replicate or contribute to the project can follow the same steps without facing the struggles we went through.

ðŸŽ¥ As proof of our work, we also captured video clips during the installation process. These recordings serve as evidence of the steps we performed and the challenges we overcame while setting up the environment.
